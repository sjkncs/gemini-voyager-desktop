## Introduction

Gemini Voyager ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect any personal information.**

Gemini Voyager operates entirely within your browser. All data generated or managed by the extension (such as folders, prompt templates, and settings) is stored:

1. Locally on your device (`chrome.storage.local`)
2. In your browser's synchronized storage (`chrome.storage.sync`) if available, to sync settings across your devices.

We do not have access to your personal data, chat history, or any other private information. We do not track your browsing history.

## Permissions

The extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **Storage**: To save your preferences, folders, and prompts.
- **ActiveTab**: To interact with the Gemini interface when you use the extension.

## Third-Party Services

Gemini Voyager does not share any data with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
