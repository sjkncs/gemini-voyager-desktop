# Welcome Aboard

Congratulations. You’ve just upgraded your intellect.
Gemini Voyager isn’t just a utility; it’s a workflow. Here is how to make the most of it in your first 5 minutes.

## 1. The Setup

If you haven't installed it yet, head over to the [Installation Guide](/guide/installation).
Once installed, refresh your Gemini tab. You’ll see the difference immediately.

## 2. The Timeline

Start a conversation. A long one. Ask about the history of typography or the physics of black holes.
Look to the right.
**That strip of dots? That’s your map.**

- **Hover** to peek at what you said.
- **Click** to teleport there.
- **Long-press** to star a moment you want to keep.

No more endless scrolling. You are now navigating at the speed of thought.

## 3. Organization

Look at your chat list on the left. Notice something new?
**Folders.**

Pick up a chat. Drag it. Drop it into a folder.
It feels natural, doesn't it? That’s because it is. You can nest them, rename them, and finally clear the clutter from your mind.

## 4. The Vault

You just wrote the perfect prompt. Don't let it disappear into the void.
Click the **Sparkle Icon** (✨) in the input box.
Save it. Tag it.

Next time? Just click the icon to find and insert it.
You aren't just chatting anymore. You are building a vault of your own genius.
