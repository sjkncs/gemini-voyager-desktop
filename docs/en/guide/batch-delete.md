# Batch Delete

Delete multiple conversations at once, no more deleting one by one.

## Features

- **Multi-select Mode**: Long-press any conversation to enter multi-select mode and check multiple conversations to delete.
- **One-click Cleanup**: Once selected, click the delete button to remove all selected conversations at once.
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time progress is displayed during deletion so you know the current status.
- **Safe Confirmation**: A confirmation dialog appears before deletion to prevent accidental operations.

</div>

## How to Use

1. In the sidebar conversation list, **long-press** any conversation item.
2. After entering multi-select mode, checkboxes will appear on the left side of each conversation.
3. Check the conversations you want to delete (up to 50 at a time).
4. Click the **Delete button** that appears.
5. Click "Confirm" in the red confirmation area that appears **above the folder list** to start the deletion.

::: tip Note
The confirmation panel overlays the folder area to avoid blocking the conversation list. Batch delete operations cannot be undone, so please proceed with caution.
