# Time Travel

Long conversations are messy. You scroll up, you scroll down, you lose your place.
Gemini Voyager turns your conversation into a timeline.

## See the Shape of Your Chat

Look at the right side of your screen.
Each node represents a message. The timeline visualizes the rhythm of your dialogue.

## Navigation, Solved.

- **Teleport**: Click a node to jump instantly to that message.
- **Peek**: Hover to see what's inside without moving.
- **Bookmark**: Long-press a node to **Star** it. It's like a bookmark for your brain.
- **Levels (Experimental)**: Right-click a node to set various levels (1-3) or collapse children. Perfect for making branched conversations clear.
- **Keyboard**: Navigate at the speed of thought. Default `j`/`k`, customize to anything.

## Even Faster with Keys

Don't want to use the mouse? Use your keyboard.

**It's like turning on Vim mode in Gemini.**

### Default Shortcuts

- `k` - Jump to previous node
- `j` - Jump to next node

### Customize It

Open extension settings, click a shortcut box, press any key you want.
Any key, any combo. `n`/`p`? `,`/`.`? Your call.

**Flow mode**: Rapid presses queue up smoothly.
**Jump mode**: Instant response, max speed.
