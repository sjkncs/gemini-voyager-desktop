# Quote Reply

Gemini Voyager offers a convenient "Quote Reply" feature, making replies to specific content more precise and efficient.

## Introduction

In daily conversations, we often need to follow up on or refute a specific part of the AI's output. The traditional method involves copying that text and manually typing the `> ` symbol in the input box, which is tedious.

Voyager simplifies this process:

1. **Select to Quote**: Use your mouse to select any text in the conversation page (whether it's your question or Gemini's answer).
2. **Floating Button**: A "Quote Reply" button will automatically appear near the selected text.
3. **One-Click Insert**: Click the button, and the selected text will be automatically inserted into your input box in standard Markdown blockquote format (`> content`).

## Features

- **Context Aware**: Intelligently identifies conversation content to avoid accidental triggering in unrelated areas (like the input box itself).
- **Standard Format**: Uses universal Markdown syntax, which Gemini understands perfectly, leading to more precise responses.
- **Multi-line Support**: If multiple lines of text are selected, Voyager automatically adds quote symbols to each line to keep the format clean.

## Tips

- **Follow up on details**: Select a confusing concept in Gemini's answer, click quote, and then type "Please explain this concept in detail."
- **Correct errors**: Select incorrect code or facts in the answer, quote them, and point out "This is incorrect, it should be..."
